# 🚗 EV Vehicle Charging Demand Prediction

### 🌱 AICTE Internship Project | Shell-Edunet Skills4Future | July–August 2025

This repository contains the project developed during my 4-week internship under the **Shell-Edunet Skills4Future program**, in collaboration with **AICTE** and **Edunet Foundation**. The project aims to predict **electric vehicle (EV) charging demand** using machine learning techniques, contributing to sustainable urban mobility and smart energy planning.

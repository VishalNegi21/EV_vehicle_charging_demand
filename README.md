# ⚡ EV Adoption Forecasting (AICTE Internship Project)

This repository contains work in progress for my AICTE internship project, organized by Edunet Foundation in collaboration with AICTE & Shell. The aim is to forecast future electric vehicle (EV) adoption using registration data provided by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).

## 📘 Project Description

As electric vehicles become more popular, it's important for urban planners to anticipate infrastructure needs like charging stations. This project focuses on predicting EV growth over time using historical data, helping guide smarter planning decisions.

  - Non-Electric Vehicles
  - Vehicle Type (Passenger, Truck)
  - Percent Electric Vehicles

## 📌 Current Status

Work for Week 1 is underway, including:
- Data loading and exploration
